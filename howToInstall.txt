How to install DesktopLimboKeys

Welcome to the installation guide for the DesktopLimboKeys game!
This guide will help you get started quickly and easily, even if you're not familiar with using the command line.

--------------------------------------------------
First of all we need Pyhton to run the commands!
    Install it from here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
--------------------------------------------------

Step 1: Download the game

Option A: Using Git (hard mode if you aren't familiar with Git)

    Open your command prompt:
    Windows: Search for 'cmd' in the Start menu and open it.
    Linux: Open the Terminal.
    Type the following command and press Enter:
    git clone https://github.com/impavloh/DesktopLimboKeys
    This will download the game files to your computer.

Option B: Download ZIP file (easy mode)

    Visit the GitHub page: https://github.com/impavloh/DesktopLimboKeys
    Click the green 'Code' button and select 'Download ZIP'
    Once downloaded, unzip the file to a location of your choice (e.g. Desktop)

--------------------------------------------------

Step 2: Open the project directory

    Navigate to the folder where you extracted the game or cloned with Git.
    If you're unsure how to do this:
        Open that folder in Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Linux) (or use cd <foldername>).
        Click on the address bar, type 'cmd' and press Enter. This will open the command prompt or terminal in that folder.

--------------------------------------------------

Step 3: Install the game requirements

    In the command prompt or terminal, type the following command and press Enter:
        pip install -r requirements.txt
    This command installs all necessary dependencies for the game.

--------------------------------------------------

Step 4: Start the game

    To launch the game, type the following in your command prompt or terminal and press Enter:

    Windows:
        python menu.py

    Linux:
        python3 menu.py

    The menu should now start, and you can begin playing! FOCUS
