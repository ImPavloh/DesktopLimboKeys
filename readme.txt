Huge shoutout to the legends who made this possible:

RobTop for providing the game assets, including sprites and sound
Mindcap for the inspiration behind the Geometry Dash level "Limbo" - ID: 86084399
Crohn44 for the inspiration for the final part of Limbo (the keys concept)
Flat-it for the custom font used in Geometry Dash.
NightHawk22 for composing the original music.
Quasar098 for the original code related to the animation of the keys and the server-client communication. At first my plan was to just submit a PR, but I felt motivated to develop a project from the ground up using his work as inspiration :)

While I admit the code for this project isn't flawless, I'm happy with the results and plan to refine it over time :3
